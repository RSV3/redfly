maybe have another state, initializing, and have the loader show up immediately with some static text ("Getting chummy with gmail..."). Takes a bit currently because it has to conenct to the gmail servers



<loader:>
	<div class="hide">
		<div id="loadingStarted">
			{#unless equal(_loadercurrent, _loadertotal)}
				<div>{_loadercurrent} of {_loadertotal}</div>
				<div class="progress progress-striped active">
					<div class="bar" style="width: {_loaderpercent}%;"></div>
				</div>
			{else}
				All done! <a {{action cleanUpThisTHingAndGoToClassify}}>Start classifying</a>, dude.
			{/}
		</div>
	</div>

	<div id="signupMessage" class="modal fade hide" tabindex="-1" role="dialog">
		<div class="modal-header">
			<button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal">&times;</button>
			<h3>You're all set!</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="modal-body">
			<p>You've successfully connected and your email is being parsed at this very moment, when Redfly is done you'll be able to classify the contacts it finds. Parsing progress is displayed in the corner, in the meantime check out your profile!</p>
		</div>
		<div class="modal-footer">
			<button class="btn" data-dismiss="modal">Close</button>
		</div>
	</div>
