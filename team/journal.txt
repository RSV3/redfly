validation utility:
- filters should be able to handle whatever a user could put (or not put) in an input field, so preeeetty much anything.
- validate functions intentionally don't allow returning arrays of errors, because the error messages are intended to be displayed on a field-by-field
  basis (not one big list for the whole form).


- A contact must have at least one entry in its 'names' OR one entry in its 'emails'
  - tighter constraint: email required is being enforced in the frontend now

- search frontend features
  - esc and losing focus closes results
  - clicking a tag name starts a search for that tab
  - arrow keys move between results
  - clicking (or pressing enter if using arrow keys)
- search backend features
  - multiple terms, space delimited
  - prefix search term with type (eg., 'tag:')
  - no duplicates in results

- lots of bindings stuff only SEEMS to work because the model data happens to be loaded already. Notable places this happens are the activity
  feed implicitly loading a few contacts and the search box loading many more
- you must use an object, not an id, when making a belongsTo relationship
