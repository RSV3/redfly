  * provides one API to access multiple mail accounts
  * users still need to link their mail accounts











- does rapportive have an api? Another way to get a picture form email?

ideas:
- make a cool graph of contacts, neo4j would be great for this. Also a visualization of tags
- privacy: allow anonymous usage, perhaps even obscure contact names

Adding notes triggers e-mails to others

Redstar own tags - germs/ideas
- about them
- about us


Similar/Potential Competitors

	- parse linked in for useful past jobs for auto tagging
  - Facebook? Interests possibly, past work history
- possible connects more important than perfect  tags
- frequency of contact indicating best fit, also for calling out bullshit

- how does linked in let you search, mba etc
- meerggggggee linked in and email

- let people audit the import blob once it happens, remove people they aren't really connected to, edit tags, etc
  - "keep this person private" button

- don't provide contact details for people, provide a list of people who know him and enforce talking first
  - send an email giving permission

- maybe try 20 at once, just the important ones at first

- FIGURE OUT GMAIL API, if there is one, and let the email functionality this drive the product. Figure out what we CAN'T do.
  - search google for email scraping, there has to be a use case for this.
- gmail api, smtp directly, screen-scraping


- tagging / searching will have to be good
  - find a way to resolve related tag ambiguity (medicine vs medical vs health). Maybe force people to use categories? Granularity is not as important as getting the most results!
  - autocomplete tag? both in tagging and searching
  - multiple tag search?
  - tag cloud?







- understanding of the underlying data is crucial to glean more than the most trivial insights from visualization
- it's easy, alarmingly easy, to create a visualization that looks pretty without conveying anything at all
-  "spring" network for generating networks: iteratively push people together who know each other and push people apart who don't until the network stops springing around
- community detection algorithms, quick-and-dirty ones are good enough
- don't put yourself at the center of a graph of your contacts! (Or in it at all) It occludes the relationships between people you know, which is really what you're interested in.
- scalable visualizations generate far more 


- people that you and someone else know in common
- sigma.js?
