ideas:
- make a cool graph of contacts, neo4j would be great for this. Also a visualization of tags
- privacy: allow anonymous usage, perhaps even obscure contact names


- understanding of the underlying data is crucial to glean more than the most trivial insights from visualization
- it's easy, alarmingly easy, to create a visualization that looks pretty without conveying anything at all
-  "spring" network for generating networks: iteratively push people together who know each other and push people apart who don't until the network stops springing around
- community detection algorithms, quick-and-dirty ones are good enough
- don't put yourself at the center of a graph of your contacts! (Or in it at all) It occludes the relationships between people you know, which is really what you're interested in.
- scalable visualizations generate far more 


- people that you and someone else know in common
- sigma.js?
