	- parse linked in for useful past jobs for auto tagging
  - Facebook? Interests possibly, past work history
- possible connects more important than perfect  tags
- frequency of contact indicating best fit, also for calling out bullshit

- how does linked in let you search, mba etc
- meerggggggee linked in and email

- let people audit the import blob once it happens, remove people they aren't really connected to, edit tags, etc
  - "keep this person private" button

- don't provide contact details for people, provide a list of people who know him and enforce talking first
  - send an email giving permission

- maybe try 20 at once, just the important ones at first

- FIGURE OUT GMAIL API, if there is one, and let the email functionality this drive the product. Figure out what we CAN'T do.
  - search google for email scraping, there has to be a use case for this.
- gmail api, smtp directly, screen-scraping


- tagging / searching will have to be good
  - find a way to resolve related tag ambiguity (medicine vs medical vs health). Maybe force people to use categories? Granularity is not as important as getting the most results!
  - autocomplete tag? both in tagging and searching
  - multiple tag search?
  - tag cloud?






MVP:
- use oauth for imap AND redfly authentication
- gmail oauth
- email pull/scan, just get contact names (consider only using emails sent to and recieved from an email)
- tagging/commentup
-  POSSIBLY: search and newsfeed

- does rapportive have an api? Another way to get a picture form email?
